            <h2>Overview</h2>

            <h3>Purpose</h3>
            <!--Purpose: Imagine that you are the owner of the rafting business and have decided that
            it is time for you to have an online presence. What is the purpose? You might need to do 
            a little research if you are unfamiliar with water rafting companies.-->
            <p>Rafting | white water adventures has been newly established to provide a fun and safe experience<br>
               exploring the beautiful outdoors. Founded on a deep passion for adventure and educating communities<br>
               in river safety, outdoor safety, and enviornmental wardship. We hope to inspire you to get outside<br>
               and enjoy the world around you in a new and exciting way.</p>

            <h3>Audience</h3>
            <!--Audience: Write a statement specifically identifying your target audience for a water
            rafting website. Review the example questions posed about target audiences from the 
            learning activity on site plan sections. Include three (3) scenario questions. Include 
            both the scenario questions and answers to those questions
            
            Who are the target customers? Describe their life (or business) situation (age, financial situation,
            interests, and so on)
            What do they want?
            What do they expect to find or what questions will be answered by them accessing the website?
            What are their needs that aren't being met?
            How will my audience usually access my site (desktop, laptop, mobile device)?
            .-->
            <p>Who is white water rafting for? Anyone ages 13 and up looking for an adventure and who is considered<br>
               to be in relatively good shape. </p>
            <p>Do you need to know how to swim? No, everyone is required to wear a safety floatation device so it is not<br>
               a requirement, but be prepared for any possible time in the water.</p>
            <p>How many people can be in a single raft? Generally you should expect no more than 7 people with one of those<br>
               riders being your guide. So bring yourself and 5 of your closest family and friends for a thrilling adventure!</p>
            <p>Will you need to bring anything? No, we will have everything you need. Life jackets, helmets, paddles, wetsuits,<br>
               first aid kit, and of course the raft! </p>
