            <img src="images/profile.jpg" alt="Hello, my name is Vanessa Christensen" width="200">
            <p> Hello, my name is Vanessa Christensen. I live in the Seattle area with my 
                husband and 6 children. I am currently an online student, studying software 
                developement and learning HTML. I am taking programing with functions and Web
                Fundamentals.<br>
                This spring I am coaching track and Field both at the local High School and Middle School
                where my children attend. I love being outdoors and teaching the kids how to throw shot 
                put! Not only has it been rewarding watching my own children succeed and continually get
                PR's(personal records), it has also been a delight to see my other athletes set goals and
                achieve them. I hope to be able to continue coaching in the future.<br>
                I spent my young adult years being a stay at home parent and have not been able to continue
                my education until recently. My youngest is now in preschool and I feel like I have more 
                time to dedicate to my learning. As I take classes in software developement I am hoping I 
                will be able to learn the skills needed to be able to create a video game with my children.<br>

            <p>Washington is known as the birthplace of Starbucks coffee, Boeing, and Microsoft. Washington has a diverse
               and varied geography. The state is home to mountains, volcanoes, and coastlines. One interesting fact is 
               that Washington opperates the largest ferry fleet in the United States.
